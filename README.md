Project Aim: Use vanilla JavaScript to build a text adventure game

'A day at the zoo' is a fun text-based storybook adventure game. As a player you will be presented with different scenarios and a couple of ways to respond.   
The story will take you through, as I'm sure you guessed, a day at the zoo. But be warned, while a day at the zoo seems nice and straight forward, danger lurks just around the corner...

## 2 UXD User experience Design

***

Text adventure games have become a fairly niche area of gaming, but with the rise in popularity of text based games such as Telltale's Walking Dead there's some hope for this genre yet.  
This game aims to bring nostalgia to those that played these games in the past, or introduce them to a new generation. The game is easy to play, with a number of ways to gain points for winning and losing.


### 2.1 Strategy

#### User Goals

Users are looking to play a fun text based adventure game, with replayability and some form of competitiveness.

#### Project goals

By making this game I hope to shine a light on the overlooked genre of text adventure games. It's a different pace for playing a computer game, but a refreshing one in my opinion.
The story takes an ordinary day at the zoo and turns it on its head. I want to capture the player's curiosity and attention to make them want to replay the game and find the different ways to end the game.

#### User Stories

- Users want to play a game that functions correctly and flows correctly
- Users want a pleasant visual experience, with easy readability
- Users want to be able to keep track of their score
- Users want to be able to easily exit the game
- Users want to be able to reset the game

- The owners want to make the game easy to understand
- The owners want to make sure game isn't too complicated
- The owners want to promote competitiveness to encourage people sharing the game with their friends
- The owners want to make it clear if each ending counts as a win or loss

### 2.2 Scope

The aim of this project was to build a game using vanilla JavaScript. I decided to go ahead with a text based adventure game with mutiple outcomes for the player to discover.

The features to include:

- Pop-up instructions for how to play the game
- Option to exit the game
- Score tracker
- Clear score option
- Win / lose sound to signal winning and losing options
- Change background image to match scenario
- Change background image to emphasize win/loss point 


### 2.3 Structure

What will this look like

### 2.4 Skeleton

What is the structure + layout going to be. Include wireframes.

#### Deviations from wireframe

If you stray from the wireframe, justify it here

### 2.5 Surface

#### Aesthetic



#### Colours



#### Fonts



#### Imagery

## 4 Technologies and Resources Used

***

### Languages

[HTML](https://html.com/): HyperText Markup Language. It is the language used as the basis of building websites and provides the main structure and format to the site.

[CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html): Cascading Style Sheets. It's the language used to make the web elements look better. It adds colour, positioning, fonts etc.

[JavaScript][https://www.w3schools.com/js/]: JavaScript is needed to control a web page's behaviour and adds more interaction for the user. 

This project uses vanilla JavaScript, meaning no external frameworks have been used.

### Programmes and Libraries Used

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/tutorials/) - used to build framework.
- [Chrome devtools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) used for finding quick solutions to design issues and visualising the site on different screen sizes for making media queries.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) used to source social media icons
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) used for version control of my site and pushing code to GitHub
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) is the cloud storage system for my projects. The location of this site's repository, and place to deploy site.
- [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) is the IDE used to write and preview the code for this website.
- [TinyJPG](https://tinypng.com/) is the site used to compress images used without compromising the quality.


### Resources for code

As a beginner, my project was mostly designed using code provided in the Code Institute lessons and example projects.
I also used many youtube tutorials for designing quizzes and text based adventure games.
I also referenced [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) for general hints.
