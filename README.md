## 4 Technologies and Resources Used

### Languages

[HTML](https://html.com/): HyperText Markup Language. It is the language used as the basis of building websites and provides the main structure and format to the site.

[CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html): Cascading Style Sheets. It's the language used to make the web elements look better. It adds colour, positioning, fonts etc.

[JavaScript][https://www.w3schools.com/js/]: JavaScript is needed to control a web page's behaviour and adds more interaction for the user. 

This project uses vanilla JavaScript, meaning no external frameworks have been used.

### Programmes and Libraries Used

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/tutorials/) - used to build framework.
- [Chrome devtools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) used for finding quick solutions to design issues and visualising the site on different screen sizes for making media queries.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) used to source social media icons
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) used for version control of my site and pushing code to GitHub
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) is the cloud storage system for my projects. The location of this site's repository, and place to deploy site.
- [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) is the IDE used to write and preview the code for this website.
- [TinyJPG](https://tinypng.com/) is the site used to compress images used without compromising the quality.


### Resources for code

As a beginner, my project was mostly designed using code provided in the Code Institute lessons and example projects.
I also used many youtube tutorials for designing quizzes and text based adventure games.
I also referenced [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) for general hints.
